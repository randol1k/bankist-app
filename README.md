# bankist-app
My first "big" project of a JavaScript application
Use the following test credentials to login:

1. user: js, password: 1111;
2. user: jd, password: 2222;
3. user: stw, password: 3333;
4. user: ss, password: 4444.

As always, the project was created and studied by Jonas Schemdtmann. I was re-writing it by myself, without hints and the source code.
